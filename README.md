ðŸŒ± GrowMode

GrowMode is a productivity web app designed to help you stay focused, track progress, and stay motivated â€” not just measure time.
Most Pomodoro websites only track how long youâ€™ve worked. GrowMode shifts the focus toward celebrating your progress â€” helping you see what youâ€™ve achieved instead of just counting minutes.

Overview

We often focus too much on how long we work and forget to appreciate how much we have accomplished. GrowMode aims to fix that by combining effective time-manahement tools with gentle motivation and smart progress tracking.

This project is still in progress, and I am continuously improving it. Here is what is already built.

Main Features

1. Pomodoro Timer

   Just like any productivity app, GrowMode includes a Pomodoro timer â€” but smarter.
   When you timer ends:
   - It automatically switches between work and rest modes.
   - Plays an alarm sound and shows a notification when time's up.
   - Helps you maintain rhythm without manual switching.
  
   You can start, stop, or reset your timer anytime. It is perfect for staying consistent during study or work sessions.

2. Task List with Auto-Sorting

   Ths task list is where GrowMode stands out.
   Tasks are automatically sorted based on:
   - Due date (The sooner go first)
   - Priority level (Urgent - High - Medium - Low)

   If a task has no due date, it's pushed to the buttom automatically.
   You just need to input:
   - Task name
   - Optional due date
   - Optional priority level
  
     GrowMode organized everything for you. You do not have to manually dragging or sorting the tasks.

3. AI-Generated Progress Report (Improving it)
   After completing tasks or finishing Pomodoro sessions, your progress will automatically update in the Weekly Report section.
   When you click 'Generate Report', GrowMode will create a personalized summary including:
   - Total Study Time
   - Total Break Time
   - Number of tasks completed
   - Total 'stars' earned (based on task priority)
   - A short motivational quote to keep you momentum going
  
Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Design: Sidebar navigation. light/dark & theme switching, responsive layout
Backend(in progress): FastAPI + SQLite + OpenAI API integration for generating reports and motivation

Future Plans
- Add user login and persistent profiles
- Improve report visualization (charts, weekly goals)
- Add AI-based motivational feedback
- Cloud data storage

Final Note
GrowMode is still evolving. I am actively refining both the design and the backend features.

Stay focused. Keep growing.ðŸŒ±
